A collection of all my past, present and future engineering and other STEM-related projects.
Let's see if this works.

### KEMPER ENGINEERING LLC INTERNSHIP

*Kemper Engineering Services, LLC was established in 2006 as a post-Katrina reorganization of Kemper Imageering. The company focuses on mechanical and process equipment, structures, and systems in a variety of industries. They also have related expertise in design-based consequence management relating to blast, ballistics, fire, chemical releases, anti-terrorism requirements, and extreme weather such as hurricanes.*
*This internship involved two primary projects:
- Creating and testing SolidWorks models via Finite Element Analysis for the purpose of edifying existing ASME-PVHO code.
- Performing forensic engineering, using SolidWorks and 3D-mapping to recreate a moment-by-moment vehicle accident for the purpose of an ongoing court case.
