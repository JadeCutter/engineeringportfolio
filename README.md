# Engineering Portfolio
A collection of all my past, present and future engineering and other STEM-related projects.
Let's see if this works.

### Kemper Engineering LLC Internship
[Kemper Engineering LLC](http://www.kempereng.com/)

Kemper Engineering Services, LLC was established in 2006 as a post-Katrina reorganization of Kemper Imageering. The company focuses on mechanical and process equipment, structures, and systems in a variety of industries. They also have related expertise in design-based consequence management relating to blast, ballistics, fire, chemical releases, anti-terrorism requirements, and extreme weather such as hurricanes.*
This internship involved two primary projects:
- Creating and testing SolidWorks models via Finite Element Analysis for the purpose of edifying existing ASME-PVHO code.
- Performing forensic engineering, using SolidWorks and 3D-mapping to recreate a moment-by-moment vehicle accident for the purpose of an ongoing court case.

### NANOGrav (Cornell University)

*From the Website: Pulsar timing arrays are on track to detect long-period gravitational waves by measuring their effects on the light-travel times of pulses from rotating neutron stars (pulsars). NANOGrav monitors a set of pulsars that together form a Galactic scale gravitational-wave observatory.*
